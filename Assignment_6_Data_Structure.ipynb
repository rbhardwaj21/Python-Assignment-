        " # A1 Using a `deque` from the `collections` module to implement a queue instead of a regular Python list offers several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "'''1. Efficiency: `deque` is optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends of the sequence. When implementing a queue, you frequently need to append items to one end and remove them from the other end, which `deque` handles more efficiently than a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Constant time operations: `deque` provides constant time (`O(1)`) complexity for append and pop operations from both ends, whereas a list has `O(n)` time complexity for pop(0) operations (popping from the beginning).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Memory efficiency: `deque` uses memory more efficiently than a list when elements are frequently added and removed, especially from the beginning or the middle. This is because `deque` uses a doubly-linked list under the hood, which doesn't require resizing or copying of elements as frequently as a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Thread-safety: If your queue needs to be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously, `deque` is a better choice as it provides atomic operations which are safe for concurrent access from multiple threads. In contrast, modifying a regular list concurrently could lead to data corruption or race conditions without additional synchronization mechanisms.\n",
